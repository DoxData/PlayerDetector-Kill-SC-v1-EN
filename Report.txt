To report a player in Star Citizen, you have two main options:

1Ô∏è In-game:
If the user is committing a real-time violation, you can report it in-game using the reporting system:
1. Open the global chat (F12 to open it if it's hidden)
2. Type /report [username] [reason] and send the message
Example:
/report Player123 Chat Harassment

2Ô∏è Via a support ticket:
If the issue is more serious (cheating, persistent harassment, toxic behavior, etc.), you should submit a ticket on the RSI support website: Clicking the REPORT button in the app will link you directly to the support website.

The most appropriate ticket type is Gameplay Issues, as this is an in-game issue. In the ticket, please include:
- Name of the offending player
- Date and time of the incident
- Description of the issue
- Screenshots or videos as evidence (if possible)

If it's something very serious, such as cheating or bug exploitation, you can also report it on:
- The official forums
- The official Star Citizen Discord
