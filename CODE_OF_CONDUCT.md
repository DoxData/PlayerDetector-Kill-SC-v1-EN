# PlayerDetector Kill SC Code of Conduct
*Version .v1 - Adapted for Gaming Communities*

## 👥 Our Commitment
In the Star Citizen universe and in our project, we value:
- **Fair Play** (anti-cheat, fair play, respect for game mechanics)
- **Privacy** (protection of user data and game statistics)
- **Technical Collaboration** (responsible reporting of bugs and vulnerabilities)

We commit to maintaining a space free of:
🚫 Unauthorized code modifications for competitive advantage
🚫 Use of game exploits through our tool
🚫 Toxic discussions about race, gender, or in-game abilities

## 🛡️ SC Community Standards
**Expected Behavior:**
- Report bugs/errors through the official system (do not make them public without patch)
- Respect the security policy when analyzing game logs
- Use appropriate language in support channels (avoid game lore spoilers)

**Zero Tolerance for:**
- Reverse engineering to alter game metrics
- Blackmail using data obtained from logs
- Discussions about cheating/hacking in Star Citizen

## ⚖️ Enforcement System
**Moderation Levels:**

| Severity | Consequence | Duration |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Minor | Private warning + Best practices guide | 7 days without reporting issues |
| Moderate | PR lock + Mandatory review | 30 days |
| Severe | Repository ban + Report to RSI* | Permanent |

**Real Case Examples:**
1. *"User X modified the code to hide PvP kills"* → **Permanent ban + notification to CIG**
2. *"Discussion about exploiting loading bug using the tool"* → **Thread deletion + 30 days without access**

## 📬 Reporting Issues
**Official Channels:**
- Official Discord: `#report-moderation` (response in <4h)
- Security Email: `conduct@doxdata-tools.com` (PGP available)

**Confidential Process:**
1. Screenshot/Log
2. Submission with technical context (no personal details)
3. Investigation by a neutral team (3 members)
4. Anonymized public resolution
